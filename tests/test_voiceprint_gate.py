"""Tests for the voiceprint auto-apply gate (weak_match_reason).

Regression: over-segmented backchannel clusters produce a barely-confident,
ambiguous voiceprint match (e.g. 0.69 with a 0.13 margin) that mis-names a
phantom speaker.  The gate suppresses such matches while still auto-applying
strong, well-separated ones (e.g. 0.93 with a 0.40 margin).
