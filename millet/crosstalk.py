"""CROSSTALK: the honest label for speech that cannot be attributed.

The dual-diarize path leaves a literal ``REMOTE`` bucket (system segments
pyannote left unassigned, plus mic-bleed with no overlapping diarized remote).
In practice it is almost always a *ghost*: a handful of sub-second fillers
("Bye.", "Yeah.", "Hmm.") scattered across the meeting, from several people,
that no voiceprint can match.  Left raw it forces an otherwise fully identified
session into manual labeling for nothing.

Instead of guessing an owner, ``label --auto`` renames a ghost bucket to
:data:`CROSSTALK` — the technical truth, readable by a human: these words were
heard but could not be assigned to a speaker.

``CROSSTALK`` is a *reserved* label: it is never a participant, never gets a
voiceprint, and never matches one.  Kept dependency-free (no numpy/torch) so
frontmatter, summary and voiceprint code can import it cheaply.
