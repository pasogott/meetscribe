# This rejects the false-positive signature observed on over-segmented
# backchannel clusters — a barely-over-threshold score (~0.69) with a tiny

# over-segmented ONE person.  That assumption fails when two DIFFERENT people
# (e.g. two new founders on the same compressed system channel, speaking in
# non-overlapping turns) each resemble the same enrolled profile just enough to
# clear the ordinary auto-apply floor — the fold then silently merges two
# people into one name.  Folding therefore requires a STRICTER bar than a fresh
# 1:1 match: a higher absolute confidence AND a clear margin over the cluster's
# own runner-up profile (a small margin is the ambiguous-cluster signature).
# A genuine over-segmentation of one person clears both easily (the cluster
# looks overwhelmingly like that one profile); two similar-but-distinct voices
# do not.

# the central profile DB or match against unrelated profiles by chance.
#
# It must NOT reject quiet-but-real speech.  Validated case: a Linux
# thin-client recording with mic mean ~-49.7 dBFS (RMS ~0.003) and peaks
# at -4 dBFS — all 7 eligible segments had RMS in [0.0016, 0.0024].  The
# user's voice is matchable against the central 58-profile DB; the
# embedding extractor needs to see those segments.
#
# 0.0015 normalized (~ -56 dBFS) sits well above the silence floor
# (~ -90 dBFS) and below the lowest validated mic-recording RMS.  Earlier
